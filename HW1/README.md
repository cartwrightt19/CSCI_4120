## Dependencies:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- sklearn

## Quick start:
- Clone repository
- cd to folder where ipynb is saved
- run command "jupyter -notebook" to open jupyter notebook in folder
- run HW1.ipynb

## End Results
- Accuracy for this data set and model remains mostly stable in the range of 75 - 85% and is not dependent on k in the range of 1 - 20.
- Accuracy does not depend on k, but is more related to data structure and clustering.
- Accuracy starts to decrease when k starts to reach 30, this is when K is so big that it is more than the number of samples inside a class.
- (See ipynb for detailed reasoning and findings)
